Quantum entanglement is when a system is in a "superposition" of more than one state. But what do those words mean? The usual example would be a flipped coin. You flip a coin but don't look at the result. You know it is either heads or tails. You just don't know which it is. Superposition means that it is not just unknown to you, its state of heads or tails does not even exist until you look at it (make a measurement). If that bothers you, you are in good company. If it doesn't bother you, then I haven't explained it clearly enough.

You might have noticed that I explained superposition more than entanglement. The reason for that is you need superposition to understand entanglement. Entanglement is a special kind of superposition that involves two separated locations in space. The coin example is superposition of two results in one place. As a simple example of entanglement (superposition of two separate places), it could be a photon encountering a 50-50 splitter. After the splitter, the photon could be In path A, or it could be in path B. In this case, the superposition is between a photon in path A and no photon in path B and no photon in path A and a photon in path B.

As a normal human being, you think that it is in just one or the other, and it is just that you don't know which. But in fact, it is in both, until you actually measure it. Again, that normal human being wants to say that if I measured it and found it in path A, it was in path A even if I hadn't measured it. But making that assumption gets you into trouble. Assuming the particle has that definite characteristic before you actually measured it, leads to measured results that are just not possible.
